<!--The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
Using The class Attribute
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet.
 It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city".
All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .
city style definition in the head section:-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <style>
        .city{
            background-color: red;
            color:white;
            border:2px solid black;
            margin:10px;
            padding:10px;
            text-align:center;
            
        }
    </style>
    <body>
<div class="city">
    <h2>bhubaneswar is beautiful city of Odisha</h2>

</div>
<div class="city">
    <h2>cuttack is beautiful city of Odisha</h2>
</div>
<div class="city">
    <h2>paradeep is beautiful city of Odisha</h2>
    </div>
    </body>
