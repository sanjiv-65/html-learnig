<!--first we have to save the icon in a folder as .ico or as image file-->
<!--To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver,
 or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. 
 A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>favicon</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>this is heading</h2>
        <p>this is paragraph</p>
        </body>
        </html>
