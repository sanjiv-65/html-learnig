<!--A block-level element always starts on a new line, 
and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available
 (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.-->
