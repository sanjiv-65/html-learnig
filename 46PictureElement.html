<!--The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements,
     each referring to different images through the srcset attribute.
      This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<h2>The picture Element</h2>

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:auto;">
</picture>

<p>Resize the browser to see different versions of the picture loading at different viewport sizes.
The browser looks for the first source element where the media query matches the user's current viewport width,
and fetches the image specified in the srcset attribute.</p>

<p>The img element is required as the last child tag of the picture declaration block.
The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
